  Scenario: Getting a chips challenge
    Given I open "/course/test/skill/_chips_test1"
    Then chips challenge looks correct
    Given I open "/course/test/skill/_chips_test0"
    Then I read "Translate"
    And I read "How"
    And I read "are"
    And I read "you"
    And I read "today?"
    And I don't read "undefined"
    Then I see a panel with only a skip button
    And I see the correct chips

  Scenario: Using the mini-dictionary
    Given I open "/course/test/skill/_chips_test1"

    And words without a definition have no tooltip
    
  Scenario: Submitting an incorrect solution
